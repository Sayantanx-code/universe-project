# universe-project
This project is a dynamic simulation of our solar system, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes multiple planets with accurate orbital speeds, relative distances, and realistic planet sizes. The project simulates the movement of planets around the sun with smooth animations, providing a visually engaging and educational experience.
Features:
Realistic orbital movement and planet sizes.

Accurate distances between planets.

Tooltips or labels for each planet to display its name.

Smooth animations of planetary movements using JavaScript.

Custom background starfield to enhance the simulation.

All major planets included with accurate data (e.g., Earth, Mars, Jupiter, etc.).
Technologies Used:
HTML for the structure of the simulation.

CSS for styling the planets, starfield, and animations.

JavaScript for the movement simulation and interactions.
# Advanced Solar System Simulation

## Description
This project is a dynamic simulation of our solar system, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes multiple planets with accurate orbital speeds, relative distances, and realistic planet sizes. The project simulates the movement of planets around the sun with smooth animations, providing a visually engaging and educational experience. The background starfield is dynamically generated, adding to the realism.

## Features
- Realistic orbital movement and planet sizes.
- Accurate distances between planets.
- Tooltips or labels for each planet to display its name.
- Smooth animations of planetary movements using JavaScript.
- Custom background starfield to enhance the simulation.
- All major planets included with accurate data (e.g., Earth, Mars, Jupiter, etc.).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for the structure of the simulation.
- **CSS** for styling the planets, starfield, and animations.
- **JavaScript** for the movement simulation and interactions.

## Installation
